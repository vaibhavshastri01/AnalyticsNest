About this dataset

The dataset contains records of patients who had undertaken an experiment drug for a certain disease. We will have to find how each attribute is affecting the days to recover column.
Each person's age, gender, city, bmi (body-mass-index), sleep (in hours) was recorded, along with days to recovery.
The problem statement we seek to address here is to find which among the attributes age, gender, city, bmi, sleep, might affect the days to recover.
